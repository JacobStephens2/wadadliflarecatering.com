# Overview
This is the specification for the website for Wadadli Flare Catering.

# Situation and Intent
Chef Jamie has a website already, but he finds it not very clear or navigable, not so customizable as it is hosted on GoDaddy, and thinks that it makes people think he just does Caribbean catering. He wants to make sure customers understand that he does a wide variety of cuisines, and he wants to break into a slightly higher end market, especially along the mainline west of Philadelphia and in West Chester, PA. His current market around Elverson is a a bit cheap he finds.

# Business
Wadadli Flare Catering (WFC) is owned and operated by Chef Jamie Francis, based in Elverson, Pennsylvania. It is a catering company that offers partial catering (as in, they do not offer full labor to cater a large event that needs a lot of labor). WFC brings the flavors of the Caribbean to the Twin Valley, Pennsylvania and surrounding areas, recently breaking into serving West Chester and the main line, while also featuring many American favorites. WFC offers drop offs, pick ups, and Chef Jamie can stay at an event to serve the food he brings. He can collaborate with other workers at the event if needed.

Given Chef Jamie's vast array of culinary experience, he can prepare a wide variety of foods, including American, French, Italian, Caribbean, and more. He specializes in custom menus.


# Sayings
Let us take some work out of your summer BBQ so you have more time to chill.

If you don't see something you'd like on the menu, please feel free to ask.

We love our customers, so feel free to contact us at (267) 481-5872.



# Catering Menu
Suggested_Menu.md has menu options. Old_Site_Prices.md has pricing that is on the current website. Further, the images, Wadadli_Flare_Menu_Page_1.png and Wadadli_Flare_Menu_Page_2.png, have menu information. Chef Jamie doesn't want to be pigeonholed as a solely Caribbean chef, but rather as a more broadly capable and higher end caterer.

Different menus should be displayed on different pages (different pages for different service types, such as weddings, corporate events, and private events).


# Reviews
WFC has Facebook Reviews and Google Reviews. 

# Sitemap, pages, and website menu structure
Wadadli_Flare_Sitemap.md contains a sitemap, or list of pages that the website should have. There are also some notes about menu and page structure in the Call_notes.md file.

# Chef Jamie Francis
I have been working in the Culinary Field for the past 34 years.  Upon graduating from Culinary school in the Caribbean in 1989, I was immediately employed at St. James Club, Antigua, a 5 Star Resort.  During my 14 years of employment, I climbed the ranks, starting as a Line Cook and finished as the Executive Chef, managing the 5 Restaurants on the property of different cuisines. (Italian, French, Caribbean, American & Asian).  Also during that time, I intermittently attended the Culinary Institutes of America, for a variety of courses that included Soups, Stocks & Sauces, Asian, Grade Manger, Flavor Dynamics, Smoke House and Mediterranean. 

In 2000, I moved to the United States, and lived in Long Beach, California, for 2 years.  I worked as a Chef at Le Jardin Du Tea, and as a Banquet Sous Chef at The Ritz Carlton Marina Del Rey Hotel.   

I then moved to Pennsylvania, where I am currently living with my family for the past 20 years. For the first 4 years, I worked at several restaurants, which included Bamboo Club, PF Chang’s and Applebee’s. Then for the past 16 years, I worked for 12th Street Catering Company, as the Chef/General Managing the Café at United States Liability Insurance.   During this time, I also worked on a variety of Catered Events, which included BBQs, Weddings, and Holiday Parties in the Corporate and Private sectors.  

I am now the proud owner of Wadadli Flare Catering!  Based on my experiences and knowledge mentioned above, I am looking forward to applying my unique culinary skills to satisfying my customers, and managing a successful business!
