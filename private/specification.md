# Overview
This is the specification for the website for Wadadli Flare Catering.

# Situation and Intent
Chef Jamie has a website already, but he finds it not very clear or navigable, not so customizable as it is hosted on GoDaddy, and thinks that it makes people think he just does Caribbean catering. He wants to make sure customers understand that he does a wide variety of cuisines, and he wants to break into a slightly higher end market, especially along the mainline west of Philadelphia and in West Chester, PA. His current market around Elverson is a a bit cheap he finds.

# Business
Wadadli Flare Catering (WFC) is owned and operated by Chef Jamie Francis, based in Elverson, Pennsylvania. It is a catering company that offers partial catering (as in, they do not offer full labor to cater a large event that needs a lot of labor). WFC brings the flavors of the Caribbean to the Twin Valley, Pennsylvania and surrounding areas, recently breaking into serving West Chester and the main line, while also featuring many American favorites. WFC offers drop offs, pick ups, and Chef Jamie can stay at an event to serve the food he brings. He can collaborate with other workers at the event if needed.

Given Chef Jamie's vast array of culinary experience, he can prepare a wide variety of foods, including American, French, Italian, Caribbean, and more. He specializes in custom menus.

# Marketing Strategy
Anywhere American and Caribbean cuisines are mentioned together, mention American cuisine first, so as to limit initial impressions that WFC is primarily an island cooking company, and instead to help give the impression that WFC does many styles of cuisine at a high level.

# Sayings
Let us take some work out of your summer BBQ so you have more time to chill.

If you don't see something you'd like on the menu, please feel free to ask.

We love our customers, so feel free to contact us at [phone number].


# Tag Line
The two main ingredients in our dishes are LOVE & PASSION.


# Catering Menus
Suggested_Menu.md has menu options. Old_Site_Prices.md has pricing that is on the current website. Chef Jamie doesn't want to be pigeonholed as a solely Caribbean chef, but rather as a more broadly capable and higher end caterer.

Different menus should be displayed on different pages (different pages for different service types, such as weddings, corporate events, and private events).


# Reviews
WFC has Facebook Reviews and Google Reviews. 


# Sitemap, pages, and website navigation structure
Wadadli_Flare_Sitemap.md contains a sitemap, or list of pages that the website should have. There are also some notes about navigation and page structure in the Call_notes.md file.


# Policies
Policies can be found in the Policies.md file.

# Chef Jamie Francis
I have been working in the Culinary Field for the past 34 years.  Upon graduating from Culinary school in the Caribbean in 1989, I was immediately employed at St. James Club, Antigua, a 5 Star Resort.  During my 14 years of employment, I climbed the ranks, starting as a Line Cook and finished as the Executive Chef, managing the 5 Restaurants on the property of different cuisines. (Italian, French, Caribbean, American & Asian).  Also during that time, I intermittently attended the Culinary Institutes of America, for a variety of courses that included Soups, Stocks & Sauces, Asian, Grade Manger, Flavor Dynamics, Smoke House and Mediterranean. 

In 2000, I moved to the United States, and lived in Long Beach, California, for 2 years.  I worked as a Chef at Le Jardin Du Tea, and as a Banquet Sous Chef at The Ritz Carlton Marina Del Rey Hotel.   

I then moved to Pennsylvania, where I am currently living with my family for the past 20 years. For the first 4 years, I worked at several restaurants, which included Bamboo Club, PF Chang’s and Applebee’s. Then for the past 16 years, I worked for 12th Street Catering Company, as the Chef/General Managing the Café at United States Liability Insurance.   During this time, I also worked on a variety of Catered Events, which included BBQs, Weddings, and Holiday Parties in the Corporate and Private sectors.  

I am now the proud owner of Wadadli Flare Catering!  Based on my experiences and knowledge mentioned above, I am looking forward to applying my unique culinary skills to satisfying my customers, and managing a successful business!

# Style
Chef Jamie likes the simple, clean, readable design of https://www.kristinascatering.com, however, he wants more of the color and Wadadli Island-flare style found in his current website, https://wadadliflarecatering.com/, and in the style inspiration images, Wadadli_Flare_Menu_Page_1.png and Wadadli_Flare_Menu_Page_2.png.

## Color
As seen in Wadadli_Flare_Menu_Page_1.png, the color palette should include:
- light sky blue (hex b2f9fe)
- dark ocean blue (hex 00b3c5)
- light coral red (hex ff4c54)
- dark crab red (hex eb444a)
- light grass green (hex 9bd83d)
- dark palm leaf green (hex 468931)
- light yellow (hex ffffac)
- dark pineapple yellow (hex fedb53)
- very dark mustard yellow (hex 8a6f1f)

Make the site colorful, but avoid rainbow motifs.

The buttons should be red by default, and another color on hover.

Sub headers should be green.

## Elements
The buttons should be spaced apart from one another. They should have some space betwen them and text above them.

## Font
Here are some good fonts for this site:
- Lango Regular or Nervatica Bold for headers
- Helsinki, Martines N50, or Kipp Clean No. 2 for sub headers
- Helvetica for text

## Accessibility Readability
Ensure that the text at least meets AA WCAG contrast readability standards.

## Logo
The logo file is logo.webp. This should be incorporated into the website design.


# Pages

## Weddings Page
The weddings page should display the suggested menu found at Suggested_Menu.md, highlighted in such a way that is relevant to weddings.

## Corporate Events Page
The corporate events page should display the suggested menu found at Suggested_Menu.md, highlighted in such a way that is relevant to corporate events.

## Private Events Page
The private events page should display the suggested menu found at Suggested_Menu.md, highlighted in such a way that is relevant to private events.

## Home Page
The hero section on the home page, if it has text in it, should make sure to have a good (at least WCAG AA) contrast with the background to amek sure it is easily legible.

The home page should use a green for sub headers.

On the home page, the user should be able to see red, green, and blue without having to scroll.

The hero section on the home page should have images that automatically change, to show the visitor different foods that Chef Jamie makes and caters (like on https://www.kristinascatering.com). The user should be able to click somewhere to get the carousel to go to the next or previous image.

The cards on the home page shoudl have images with cropped display of images so they are a consistent height in the cards.

## Contact Page
The message send status message should appear at the top of the page after the user sends a message, this way they don't need to scroll down to see what happened after submission.

The email the contact form sends should have the reply to address as the email which was entered into the contact form, making it easy to reply to whoever filled out the contact form.

## Gallery Page
The gallery should have a menu section featuring the menu images in the menu directory.

When looking at an image, a user should be able to click something to view the next image, without having to exit back out to the gallery overview and click another image.

## Contact Page
There should be a contact page which has the contact info as well as a form the user can fill out to have an email sent to Chef Jamie.

## Quote request form page
There should be a form the user can fill out to request a catering quote for an event.

## BBQ Experience
This page should have the prices from the Old_Site_Prices.md file.

## Caribbean Experience
This page should have the prices from the Old_Site_Prices.md file.

# Mobile View
The menu should be completely visible when opened on a mobile display.

# Checking Quotes
There should be a script which can check the leads in the database.

# Search Engine Optimization
The website should be optimized for display in search engines.


# Technology Stack
This website has the following technologies available to it:
- Ubuntu 24.04.3
- Apache 2.4.58
- PHP 8.3.6
    - composer for package management
    - phpdotenv for environment variables
- MySQL 8.0.43 (credentials in .env file)
- JavaScript (Primarily run in Google Chrome)
- CSS
- HTML
- Playwright MCP Server for browsing
- MailChimp SMTP (Mandrill)

# Directory Structure
Files to be served publicly should be in the public folder, and files to be kept private should be in the private folder.

# URL: https://wadadliflarecatering.com
The website should be accessible primarily at https://wadadliflarecatering.com. wadadli.stephens.page already points to this server. Apache Virtual Host records will probably need to be edited and certbot run to get an SSL certificate for serving the site by HTTPS. wadadliflarecatering.com should have Apache Virtual Host configuration to handle requests for that domain directed to this server.

Web page addresses should not require filename suffixes.
